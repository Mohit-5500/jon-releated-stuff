My name is Mohit Gangwani, and I am a 21-year-old pursuing Computer Science with an average CGPI of 9.3. Currently, I serve as a Placement Coordinator in my college and have participated in a hackathon where my team secured 2nd position. Additionally, I assisted several teachers as an assistant teacher during my first and second years.

My specific goals related to my career in computer science are to continuously develop my technical skills and stay up-to-date with emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I aim to gain practical experience by working on challenging projects that allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. In the short term, I intend to participate in more hackathons and develop skills in web and mobile application development. In the long term, I aspire to lead a team of developers and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions that positively impact the lives of others. Ultimately, my goal is to become a highly skilled and respected software developer and make a meaningful contribution to the field.
